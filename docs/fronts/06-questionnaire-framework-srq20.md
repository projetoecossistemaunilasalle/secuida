# Front 06 — Questionnaire Framework & SRQ-20 Test Flow

## Goal

Build questionnaire support as part of the guided-flow framework, with SRQ-20 as the first validation/test case.

SRQ-20 should not be treated as the only special or sensitive questionnaire. The architecture should support multiple structured, scored, interruptible questionnaires in the future.

---

## Principle

A questionnaire is represented as dashboard-editable JSON guided-flow content:

```txt
src/content/flows/*.json
  -> import.meta.glob discovery
  -> generic flow parser and validator
  -> generic flow engine
  -> generic chatbot UI
```

The app must not create a separate questionnaire screen, route, TypeScript workflow file, or questionnaire-specific runtime. SRQ-20 proves that the chatbot framework can execute structured, scored, interruptible flows from JSON-compatible content.

---

## SRQ-20 Role

SRQ-20 is the first implementation because it exercises the important framework capabilities:

```txt
consent
fixed question count
scoring
threshold result
safety interruption
recommendation mapping
```

It should be used to prove the questionnaire framework, not hardcoded as a unique one-off.

---

## SRQ-20 Required Behavior

* User is told clearly they are answering SRQ-20.
* User consents before beginning.
* There are 20 yes/no questions.
* Affirmative answers are scored.
* Score of 7 or more produces a possible-distress support result.
* Result copy must avoid diagnostic language.
* If the suicidal ideation question is answered affirmatively, the questionnaire stops immediately.
* The user is routed to immediate support content.
* The interrupted questionnaire should not be offered for resumption.

## JSON Model

```json
{
  "id": "srq20",
  "type": "questionnaire",
  "questionnaire": {
    "instrument": "SRQ-20",
    "scoring_method": "sum_affirmative",
    "thresholds": [
      {
        "id": "possible_distress",
        "min": 7,
        "recommendation_id": "professional-support"
      }
    ]
  },
  "safety_rules": [
    {
      "id": "srq20-q17-support",
      "when": {
        "node_id": "q17",
        "answer_value": true
      },
      "action": "route_to_support",
      "target": "/apoio"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Testing Requirements

Minimum tests:

```txt
loads valid questionnaire
rejects questionnaire without consent
rejects missing question IDs
rejects broken next references
scores affirmative answers correctly
maps score >= 7 to correct result
Q17 affirmative interrupts immediately
Q17 affirmative prevents resume
declined consent exits gracefully
result copy avoids diagnosis wording
```

---

## Acceptance Criteria

* SRQ-20 is represented as JSON-compatible content.
* Questionnaire logic is generic.
* Scoring is not implemented inside React components.
* Safety rules are declarative.
* SRQ-20 validates successfully.
* SRQ-20 tests pass.
* The framework can support another questionnaire without major refactor.

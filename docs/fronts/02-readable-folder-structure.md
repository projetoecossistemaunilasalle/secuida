# Front 02 — Readable Folder Structure

## Goal

Create a folder structure that is easy to read, easy to scale, and friendly to both developers and future AI agents.

The structure should make product domains visible.

---

## Principles

1. Features should be obvious.
2. Domain logic should not live inside React components.
3. Editable content should not be hidden inside JSX.
4. The guided-flow engine should be independent from UI.
5. Future dashboard-editable data should live in JSON-compatible structures.
6. Privacy-sensitive logic should be explicit and easy to audit.

## Naming Conventions

Use product language for user-facing features:

```txt
home
orientation
support
contacts
education
```

Use technical language only where it clarifies architecture:

```txt
domain
flow-engine
design-system
content
lib
```

Avoid emotionally heavy names in routes and files where possible. For example, prefer:

```txt
features/support
```

over:

```txt
features/crisis
```

Internally, safety rules may still use precise names when needed, but product-facing naming should be calm.

---

## What Belongs Where

### `features/`

React screens and feature-specific UI.

### `domain/`

Business/domain logic independent from React.

Examples:

- flow runtime;
- scoring;
- safety rules;
- questionnaire behavior;
- resource types;
- privacy policy rules.

### `content/`

Editable or future-dashboard data.

Examples:

- flow JSON;
- services;
- resources;
- copy blocks;
- support contacts.

### `design-system/`

Reusable visual primitives.

### `lib/`

Generic utilities that are not specific to SeCuida’s domain.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A new developer can find every main product area in under one minute.
- The flow engine can be tested without rendering React.
- Flow files can be edited without touching TypeScript.
- Resource and service content is not embedded in JSX.
- Privacy-sensitive logic has a clear location.

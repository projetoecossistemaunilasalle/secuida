# Fronts 01-05 Implementation Plans

These plans turn the existing SeCuida prototype into a routed, feature-organized, content-driven PWA foundation and the first guided-flow/chat framework.

They consolidate:

- `docs/PRD.md`
- `docs/Project-Context.md`
- `docs/fronts/README.md`
- Fronts `01` through `05` and their `A` breakdowns
- the current React/Vite app structure

## Current Implementation Snapshot

As of the 2026-05-16 documentation audit, the source tree already contains routed app infrastructure, feature folders, design-system primitives, structured content, a deterministic guided-flow engine, SRQ-20 questionnaire domain logic, and Vitest coverage.

These plan files are still useful as implementation intent and acceptance criteria, but they should not be read as proof that a front is incomplete. Check `docs/Project-Context.md` and the source tree before starting new work.

## Required Execution Method

Every implementation step in these plans must use a RED-GREEN-REFACTOR loop and should explicitly delegate bounded work to subagents when the environment supports them.

Use the loop this way:

1. **RED**: ask a subagent to add or update the smallest failing test, type assertion, smoke check, or documented acceptance check for the step.
2. **GREEN**: ask a worker subagent to implement only the code needed to satisfy that failing check.
3. **REFACTOR**: ask a separate review/refactor subagent to inspect the changed files for duplication, accessibility, privacy drift, and architectural leakage.

Subagents should receive narrow ownership. They must not revert unrelated edits, and they must report changed paths.

## Global Guardrails

- Do not add login, accounts, backend behavior, analytics, localStorage, saved answers, saved chat transcripts, or location persistence.
- Keep routes calm and Portuguese-first. Use `/apoio`, not `/crise`.
- Keep the app mobile-first and preserve bottom navigation.
- Keep domain/content modules independent from React.
- Treat all support, service, resource, and mental-health copy as reviewable content.
- Run `npm run lint` and `npm run build` before merging each completed slice.
